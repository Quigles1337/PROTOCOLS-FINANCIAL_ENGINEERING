# Algorand Financial Primitives

Production-grade PyTeal implementations of cross-chain financial primitives.

## Contracts

### 1. TrustLines (207 lines)
Bilateral credit networks with payment rippling

**Features:**
- Bilateral credit limits between two parties
- Balance tracking with deterministic account ordering
- **Payment rippling** through up to 6 hops for liquidity aggregation
- Quality parameters (basis points) for DEX integration
- ASA (Algorand Standard Asset) settlement support
- Emergency freeze capabilities
- Credit availability queries

**Operations:**
- `create` - Establish bilateral trust line
- `send` - Direct payment between parties
- `ripple` - Multi-hop payment through intermediaries
- `quality` - Update quality in/out parameters
- `ripple_set` - Enable/disable rippling
- `limits` - Update credit limits (atomic group required)
- `freeze` - Emergency freeze (admin only)
- `balance` - Query current balance
- `credit` - Get available credit in both directions
- `asa_opt` - Opt-in to ASA for collateralization
- `settle` - Settle credit with ASA transfer

### 2. PaymentChannels (135 lines)
Streaming micropayments with state channels

**Features:**
- Off-chain payment updates with on-chain settlement
- Nonce-based replay protection
- Signature verification for claims (Ed25519)
- Dispute resolution with challenge period
- Unilateral close after expiration
- Cooperative close with both parties consent
- Channel funding and extension

**Operations:**
- `create` - Open new payment channel
- `fund` - Add funds to existing channel
- `extend` - Extend channel expiration
- `claim` - Claim payment with signature
- `coop_close` - Close cooperatively
- `uni_close` - Close unilaterally after expiration
- `dispute` - Initiate dispute (challenge period)
- `get_channel` - Query channel details
- `get_balance` - Get available balance

### 3. Escrow (100 lines)
Hash-Locked Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs)

**Features:**
- Time-locked escrow (release after specific round)
- Hash-locked escrow (SHA-256 preimage verification)
- Combined time+hash locks for atomic swaps
- Expiration with sender cancellation
- Clawback mechanism for compliance

**Condition Types:**
- Type 0: None (simple time lock)
- Type 1: Hash lock only
- Type 2: Time lock only
- Type 3: Combined hash + time lock

**Operations:**
- `create` - Create escrow with conditions
- `execute` - Execute escrow (recipient, requires preimage if hash-locked)
- `cancel` - Cancel expired escrow (sender)
- `clawback` - Emergency clawback (sender, if enabled)
- `get_escrow` - Query escrow details

## Technical Specifications

### State Schemas

**TrustLines:**
- Global: 2 uints, 1 bytes
- Local: 10 uints, 5 bytes

**PaymentChannels:**
- Global: 2 uints, 1 bytes
- Local: 15 uints, 5 bytes

**Escrow:**
- Global: 2 uints, 1 bytes
- Local: 12 uints, 8 bytes

### Algorand Features Used

- **PyTeal** - Python-based smart contract language
- **Application State** - Global and local state management
- **Subroutines** - Modular code organization
- **Atomic Transfers** - Group transactions for authorization
- **SHA-256** - Cryptographic hash verification
- **Round Numbers** - Time-based conditions
- **ASA Support** - Algorand Standard Asset integration

### Financial Engineering

**TrustLines** implements correspondent banking networks:
- Credit lines represent bilateral trust relationships
- Payment rippling enables liquidity aggregation across multiple hops
- Quality parameters model fees/spreads for market making
- Deterministic account ordering ensures consistent state storage

**PaymentChannels** implement state channel scaling:
- Off-chain updates provide 1000x+ throughput improvement
- Cryptographic signatures ensure authenticity
- Game-theoretic dispute resolution protects against fraud
- Challenge periods allow time for counterclaims

**Escrow** implements atomic swap primitives:
- Hash locks enable cross-chain atomic swaps
- Time locks provide safety/liveness guarantees
- Combined locks support complex multi-party protocols
- Clawback enables regulatory compliance

## Compilation

Compile to TEAL bytecode:

```bash
cd contracts
python3 trust_lines.py
python3 payment_channels.py
python3 escrow.py
```

This generates approval and clear state programs in TEAL.

## Testing

Deploy to Algorand TestNet for testing:

```bash
# Deploy contract
goal app create --creator $CREATOR \
  --approval-prog trust_lines_approval.teal \
  --clear-prog trust_lines_clear.teal \
  --global-byteslices 1 --global-ints 2 \
  --local-byteslices 5 --local-ints 10

# Opt-in
goal app optin --app-id $APP_ID --from $ACCOUNT

# Create trust line
goal app call --app-id $APP_ID --from $ACCOUNT \
  --app-arg "str:create" \
  --app-arg "addr:$COUNTERPARTY" \
  --app-arg "int:0" \
  --app-arg "int:1000000" \
  --app-arg "int:1000000" \
  --app-arg "int:1"
```

## Remaining Contracts (In Development)

- Checks - Deferred payment instruments
- DEXOrders - On-chain orderbook with matching
- DIDManager - Decentralized identifiers (W3C)
- DepositAuthorization - KYC/AML compliance
- DepositPreauth - One-time authorizations
- SignerList - Weighted multisig
- AccountDelete - Account lifecycle management
