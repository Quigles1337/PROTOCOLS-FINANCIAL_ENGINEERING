# NEAR XRPL Financial Primitives

Production-grade implementation of XRPL-inspired financial primitives in Rust for the NEAR Protocol.

## Overview

This implementation brings all 10 XRPL financial primitives to NEAR using Rust and the near-sdk, leveraging NEAR's gas-efficient execution model and cross-contract calls.

## Contracts Implemented

All 10 financial primitives are production-ready with comprehensive features:

### 1. **TrustLines** (135 lines)
Bilateral credit lines with payment rippling for multi-hop credit networks.

**Key Features**:
- Bidirectional credit limits with positive/negative balance tracking
- Deterministic key generation for consistent storage

**Technical Implementation**:
```rust
pub struct TrustLine {
    pub account1: AccountId,
    pub account2: AccountId,

## Technical Architecture

### NEAR SDK Patterns

All contracts follow production-grade NEAR patterns:

1. **State Management**
   - BorshSerialize/BorshDeserialize for efficient storage
   - UnorderedMap for scalable key-value storage
   - PanicOnDefault for initialization safety

2. **Authorization**
   - `env::predecessor_account_id()` for caller identification
   - Signer verification on sensitive operations
   - Owner-based access control

3. **Token Handling**
   - `#[payable]` macro for NEAR token deposits
   - `Promise::new(receiver).transfer(amount)` for payments
   - `env::attached_deposit()` for deposit validation

4. **Time Logic**
   - `env::block_timestamp()` for timestamps (nanoseconds)
   - Block-based expiration and grace periods
   - Consistent time handling across contracts

5. **Error Handling**
   - Descriptive assertion messages
   - Panic on invalid states
   - Clear error propagation

### Storage Optimization

- **UnorderedMap**: O(1) lookups with minimal storage
- **Borsh Serialization**: Compact binary format
- **Lazy Loading**: Collections loaded on-demand
- **Gas Efficiency**: Optimized for NEAR's gas model

### Cross-Contract Calls

- **Promises**: Async transfer handling
- **Callbacks**: For multi-step operations
- **Gas Allocation**: Proper gas budgeting

```

near call signer-list.testnet approve_proposal '{"proposal_id": 0}' --accountId signer2.testnet

# Execute
near call signer-list.testnet execute_proposal '{"proposal_id": 0}' --accountId signer1.testnet
```

## Security Considerations

1. **No Reentrancy**: NEAR's execution model prevents reentrancy attacks
2. **Integer Overflow**: Rust's default overflow checks prevent arithmetic errors
3. **Access Control**: All sensitive operations check `predecessor_account_id()`
4. **Gas Limits**: Proper gas allocation for cross-contract calls
5. **State Consistency**: Atomic state updates with Borsh serialization

## Testing

NEAR contracts can be tested with:

```bash
# Unit tests
cargo test

# Integration tests with near-workspaces
cargo test --features integration-tests

# Simulation tests
near-cli-rs contract call-function
```

## Deployment
